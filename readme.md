# Resona

A Spring Boot web application for managing in-store music playback. Administrators manage jingles and stores through a browser interface, while users with the `ROLE_USER` role (Store entities) connect to the music player via WebSocket.

## Authentication & Roles

Login is performed via **email and password** (Spring Security form login). Passwords are stored as BCrypt hashes.

| Role | Description | Accessible Routes |
|---|---|---|
| `ROLE_ADMIN` | Staff / administrator | All protected routes |
| `ROLE_USER` | Store entity | `/stores/{id}/{uuid}`, `/api/jingles/pause-request/{id}`, WebSocket `/ws-player/**` |

Public routes: `/auth/**`, `/onboarding/**`, `/assets/**`, `/css/**`, `/js/**`, `/users/finalize`, `/ws-player/**`, `/files/**`.

A maximum of **one active session per user** is enforced. When logging in from a new device, the existing session is invalidated and the old client is redirected to `/auth/login?expired`.

---

## Redis Session Storage

Sessions are stored in Redis under the namespace `resona:session` using `@EnableRedisIndexedHttpSession`. The **Jedis** client is used (Lettuce is excluded). This enables horizontal scaling and session persistence across application restarts.

---

## WebSocket / Player

The WebSocket endpoint `/ws-player/**` is used to connect a store (`ROLE_USER`) to the music player in real time. CSRF protection is disabled for this path (required for STOMP clients). Spring OXM is excluded from the WebSocket dependency.

---

## ElevenLabs Integration

The `ElevenlabsClient` HTTP client is created via `HttpServiceProxyFactory` on top of `RestClient`. The base URL and API key are injected through `@ConfigurationProperties` (`IntegrationProps`).

---

## File Storage

Generated jingles go to Supabase Storage when `integration.supabase.*` is configured (see Configuration). Otherwise, uploaded files are saved to disk in a directory configured via `AppProps` (`fileStorage.uploadDir`). The directory is mapped as a resource handler under `/files/**`, allowing files to be served directly by the application.

---

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

- Java 25+
- Docker & Docker Compose

### Running the Application

```bash
# PostgreSQL and Redis are started automatically via Docker Compose
# (spring-boot-docker-compose picks up compose.yml on startup)
./gradlew bootRun
```

Spring Boot DevTools is included in `developmentOnly` — the application reloads automatically on class changes.

### Configuration

Core settings are defined in `application.properties` or via environment variables:

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
| `spring.datasource.*` | PostgreSQL connection |
| `spring.data.redis.*` | Redis connection |
| `spring.mail.*` | SMTP for sending emails |
| `app.file-storage.upload-dir` | Directory for uploaded files |
| `integration.elevenlabs.base-url` | ElevenLabs base URL |
| `integration.elevenlabs.api-key` | ElevenLabs API key |
| `integration.supabase.url` | Optional. Supabase project URL, e.g. `https://agnafyaipjhixqkijmwy.supabase.co` |
| `integration.supabase.secret-key` | Optional. Supabase secret key (server only, never in the browser) |
| `integration.supabase.jingle-bucket` | Optional. Public bucket for generated jingles, defaults to `jingles` |

When the Supabase URL and secret key are set, new jingle recordings are uploaded to Supabase Storage and played from there. When they are missing, the app keeps saving files to `app.file-storage.upload-dir` as before. Jingles created earlier keep their old URLs and continue to work.

---

## Build & Docker

```bash
# Build the JAR
./gradlew bootJar

# Build the Docker image
docker build -t resona:latest .
```

The JAR is built with **layered mode** to optimize Docker image layer caching. `developmentOnly` dependencies (DevTools, Docker Compose support) are excluded from the final artifact.

Gradle build caching is configured in `gradle.properties`.

---

## Database Migrations

Migrations are applied automatically on application startup via **Flyway**. SQL files are located in `src/main/resources/db/migration/` and follow the naming convention `V{version}__{description}.sql`.

---

## Testing

Test coverage is currently minimal — there is a test for file saving. The test infrastructure includes:

- **Testcontainers** (PostgreSQL) — isolated tests against a real database
- Spring Boot Test Slices (`@DataJpaTest`, `@WebMvcTest`, etc.)
- `spring-security-test` — tests with authenticated users

```bash
./gradlew test
```

---

## Known Limitations

- No application-level caching (only session storage in Redis)
- Test coverage is minimal
